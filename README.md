- Run "rails db:migrate" and then "rails db:seed" in your terminal.
- Start a local server by running "rails s" in your terminal, and follow the local host link provided.


🇬🇧 HOW TO MOVE THROUGH THE HUNT 🇬🇧
- Each level's puzzle might have you look into all parts of the page and its architecture.
- Don't be afraid to breakout the Devloper Tools, inspect page elements, and poke around in general!
- Moving on to the next level can accomplished in a few ways: clicking a link, submitting an answer, or in other novel ways. 
- The game is designed so that you cannot progress prematurely. And if you wish to return to a previous level, you must start a new game.

🇬🇧 SCORE KEEPING & HORSE STAMINA 🇬🇧
- Your horse begins with 100 stamina. For each incorrect answer, or hint used, your horse's stamina will drop by 10.
- You're able to save your progress and resume your game from your user page but you cannot resume previous games.
- Your highscore from all attempts will persist in the Trophy Room.

🇬🇧 HINTS 🇬🇧
- If you are stuck on a level click the lightbulb for a hint. 
- Remember! Using a hint will deduct points from your horse's stamina. Careful not to ride your horse into the ground!
